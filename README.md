#My Online Resume and Mini-portfolio
## James Ruggieri

Just a basic README here for my web resume that I will host on github. Not much to get into, but I may add a few things as I get going. Its a straight forward, single page site which will use:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

Ok, I suppose there are a few things I can say about this little, tiny project.

I decided against using Bootstrap since I build my Wordpress sites with Bootstrap. I've been wanting to get into Flexbox, so I decided to use it here to see if I can leverage its cool "responsive" behaviors. The tests I did seemed to work pretty well, so this seemed like a good small project to try it out on.

I am going to add a google map to it since I learned some of the basics for google maps.

jQuery of course. Heh.

Going to use Featherlight lightbox plugin for the screenshots. I've used it before and like its small footprint and ease of use.

I may add some animations with GSAP but I'll see how it goes.

That's about it for now...
